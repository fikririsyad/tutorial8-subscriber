## Reflection
> a. What is ***amqp***?

`ampq` is an open-standard application layer protocol designed to support messaging between applications.

> b. What does `guest:guest@localhost:5672` means? 

- First `guest` refers to the username that is used for authentication.
- Second `guest` refers to the password that is used for authentication.
- `localhost:5672` tells us that the server runs on the same machine and is listening on the default port `5672`.
